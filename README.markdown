If you'd like to preview local repos, set the LOCAL_REPO_PATH environment variable. `<name>` and `<repo>` are placeholder variables.

This will load the post files directly from disk (instead of from a cloned repo), and will automatically reindex all posts after each page load.

Example: `LOCAL_REPO_PATH="/Users/<name>/Documents/<repo>" unicorn -p 9393`
